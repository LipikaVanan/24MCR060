Traditional Application
As DevOps engineers, we usually deal with applications that are either UI-based or API-based. For example a websites, its backend APIs etc.

These applications are developed with predefined logic. Meaning, we use some framework (e.g., flask, FastAPI), libraries and code them in such a way that if you input certain data, the application will process it based on the predefined logic and return an expected output.

For example,

Input comes in (login credentials, API requests using JWT, etc.)

Predefined backend logic processes it (authentication checks, business rules)

Expected output is returned (access granted/denied, API responses etc)
